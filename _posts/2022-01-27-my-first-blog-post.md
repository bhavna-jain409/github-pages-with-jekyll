 ## Hello! Hola! Bonjour! Welcome to my world!
Born and raised in Subic Bay, Philippines, 
Trisha is one of those people who left their comfortable life to travel the world and learn about life. 
Her style is to stay in one place she likes for 3 months (or more) to know what it feels like to eat, cook, speak and sleep in another culture that isn’t hers. 
She’d like to believe she’s not traditionally traveling but she just chooses to be somewhere else all the time.

## 2005: I turned 18 and asked for a trip to Hong Kong
Where I am from, you have to have a big celebration when you turn 18. Like a huge party, an intro to society.

I didn’t want to wear dresses or do the 18 roses dance or find my escort so I asked for a Hong Kong trip instead. I always wanted to go to Disneyland!

My mom agreed with the condition that she and my siblings come to the trip. That was my first trip outside of my country and I enjoyed it a lot!
